## Post-Exploitation Analysis

Privilege escalation was not executed as no interactive shell session was established. The target system is Linux-based and
Windows-specific escalation modules were not applicable.However, vsftpd will be exploit & gain the root level access & 
Tomcat Manager administrative access allows arbitrary application deployment, implying full system compromise.

after gaining the access through the vsftpd use command to shell to get the shell access i.e high level access.

A full-scope Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) was conducted against the DVWA application hosted on 192.168.1.200, following the PTES methodology. Initial reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning using OpenVAS identified multiple web application weaknesses, including reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) and potential SQL injection points.

Further exploitation was performed using sqlmap to validate SQL injection vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation confirmed that unsanitized user input was directly used in backend SQL queries, allowing database interaction without proper authorization. This demonstrated a high-risk vulnerability that could lead to sensitive data disclosure and application compromise.

The identified issues were mapped to the exploitation phase of PTES and assigned high severity based on impact and ease of exploitation. Recommended remediation includes implementing prepared statements, strict server-side input validation, and proper output encoding.

A follow-up scan is advised after remediation to confirm mitigation effectiveness. The results indicate that without corrective action, the application remains vulnerable to common but critical web attacks.

Non-Technical Summary

A security assessment was conducted on the DVWA application to evaluate its exposure to cyber threats. The assessment identified critical weaknesses that could allow attackers to access or manipulate sensitive data without authorization. These issues arise mainly from improper input validation within the application.

Successful testing confirmed that an attacker could exploit these weaknesses with minimal effort, posing a high business risk. Immediate remediation is recommended to prevent potential data breaches. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the overall security posture of the application and reduce the likelihood of real-world attacks.
