Theoretical Knowledge

1. Vulnerability Scanning Techniques
What to Learn:
Core Concepts:
Scan Types: Network (e.g., Nmap port scans), application (e.g., Nikto for web flaws), authenticated vs. unauthenticated.
Vulnerability Scoring: Use CVSS v4.0 (e.g., CVSS 8.8 for RCE = High). Example: Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) = Critical.
False Positives: Validate findings (e.g., manual checks for open ports).
Key Objectives: Configure and validate scans for accurate risk assessment.
How to Learn:
Study OWASP Testing Guide for web scanning.
Review NIST SP 800-115 for scanning methods.
Analyze WannaCry case for CVSS mapping.

2. Penetration Testing Techniques
What to Learn:
Core Concepts:
Phases: Recon (e.g., OSINT with Shodan), Scanning (e.g., Nessus), Exploitation (e.g., Metasploit), Post-Exploitation (e.g., privilege escalation), Reporting.
Methodologies: PTES, OWASP WSTG. Example: PTES for scoping web tests.
Ethics: Ensure client authorization and defined scope.
Key Objectives: Execute structured, ethical pentests.
How to Learn:
Explore PTES for phase details.
Study OWASP WSTG for web pentesting.
Review SANS pentest case studies.

3. Exploit Development Basics
What to Learn:
Core Concepts:
Exploit Types: Buffer overflows, SQL injection, XSS. Example: XSS via unescaped input.
Exploit Writing: Craft basic exploits (e.g., Python for buffer overflows) using Exploit-DB PoCs.
Mitigations: Understand ASLR, WAFs, and patching.
Key Objectives: Develop and test exploits safely.
How to Learn:
Study Exploit-DB for PoC examples.
Use TCM Security’s exploit guides.
