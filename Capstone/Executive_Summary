Non-Technical Summary:
A security assessment was conducted on the DVWA application to evaluate its exposure to cyber threats. 
The assessment identified critical weaknesses that could allow attackers to access or manipulate sensitive data without authorization. 
These issues arise mainly from improper input validation within the application.

Successful testing confirmed that an attacker could exploit these weaknesses with minimal effort, posing a high business risk. 
Immediate remediation is recommended to prevent potential data breaches. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the overall security posture of the application and reduce the likelihood of real-world attacks.
